# thru

`thru` is a C program that processes numbers via command line in a fashion
similar to ETC EOS Lighting Systems.

I work in the theatre lighting industry a lot, and enjoy using the command-line
structure of the EOS software. Of which, includes number selection styles such
as these examples:

1. `1 THRU 5` -> 1, 2, 3, 4, 5
2. `1 + 2 + 3` -> 1, 2, 3
3. `1 THRU 5 - 3` -> 1, 2, 4, 5
